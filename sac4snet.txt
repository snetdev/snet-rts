                 `-- sac2c <-- stdlib <-----'


Building order
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generally speaking, the S-NET-related packages need to be *installed* into their final locations
after being built using 'make install', while the SAC-related packages (the sac2c compiler and stdlib)
need not.

First of all, a couple of environment variables must be set:
For SAC:
    export SACBASE=$HOME/advance
    export SAC2CBASE=$SACBASE/sac2c
    export PATH=$PATH:$SAC2CBASE/bin
    export SVN_EDITOR=/bin/vi

For SNET:
    SNETBASE=/usr/local

    export SNET_LIBS=$SNETBASE/lib/snet
    export SNET_INCLUDES=$SNETBASE/include/snet
    export SNET_MISC=$SNETBASE/share/snet
    
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$SNET_LIBS:$SNETBASE/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=$SNETBASE/bin:$PATH

It is perhaps best to create a shell script called 'settings.sh' in the top-level directory ($HOME/advance),
put these commands in it, and then 'source' it into the shell session every time you start working.
It is NOT recomended to put the commands into a .bashrc or similar file.

For simplicity, this manual assumes the SNET software will be installed into the standard installation
path "/usr/local". It is possible to install into a different location (e.g. $HOME/advance/local).

This section shows the order in which the software has to be built:

1. pcl
    Use "./configure --prefix=/usr/local",
    then "make && make install"

2. lpel
    If the source code has been checked out directly from the source repository,
    you first need to create the configure script by running: "./build-aux/boostrap".
    Then use the standard: "./configure --prefix=/usr/local --with-pcl=/usr/local"
    and "make && make install"

    Hint: Check the configure log to make sure that pcl was detected.

3. sac2c
    Use "./configure --with-lpel-include-path=/usr/local/include"
    then: "make"  to build the compiler itself,
    then: "make CROSS=lpel"  to build the lpel-enabled cross-compiler.
    You may decorate the make commands with "-j4" or similar to your liking.

    Hint: Check the configure log to make sure that lpel was detected.

4. stdlib
    The basic command to build stdlib for SNet is:
        make CROSS=lpel mtfast
    For a slightly increased build speed you may decorate with "-j" and "MODE=lean".

    Important: If the LPEL library has been installed into a non-standard location
    you will need to specify the CCFLAG option to direct the gcc compiler.
    Suppose we are installing everything into "$HOME/advance/local" instead
    of "/usr/local". The stdlib make command would read:
        make CROSS=lpel mtfast CCFLAG="-I$HOME/advance/local/include -L$HOME/advance/local/lib -Wl,-rpath,$HOME/advance/local/lib"
    This is because the gcc compiler invoked from sac2c needs to know where to
    find the library.

5. snet-rts
    Use "./configure --prefix=/usr/local".
    If LPEL hasn't been detected we may add:
    "--with-lpel-includes=/usr/local/include --with-lpel-libs=/usr/local/lib"
    Then: "make && make install"
    This installs libraries into "$PREFIX/lib/snet"

6. snetc
    Use "./configure --prefix=/usr/local"
    If installing into a non-standard path, add:
        CFLAGS="-I$HOME/advance/local/include" LDFLAGS="-L$HOME/advance/local/lib"
    Then "make" to build the compiler.
    The executable file "snetc" is left in the package's top directory;
    create a symlink to it from "/usr/local/bin".

7. examples
    Build a primitive test/example in "snet-rts/examples/tests/SAC/gigo1"
    using "make". This produces the file "gigo-lpel".
    Run the program like this:
        MMAP=-1,2,4 ./gigo-lpel <input2.xml


Friendly hints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is actually quite wise NOT to use the standard installation path "/usr/local",
but instead to install into a more specific location, such as "$HOME/advance/local".
This allows to keep several versions of the system side by side.

Should the sac2c compiler go crazy about module version mismatch, you may try purging
the snet/sac libraries in "/usr/local/lib/snet".



Box metadata in .snet source files
-----------------------------------

"SACmodule"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Name of the SAC module library that contains the box function.

"SACboxfun"
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Function name in the SAC module.

"SACdefaultmap"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Default mapping of SAC bees (tasks) to LPEL workers.
Two possible formats:
    a) Comma separated list of worker IDs (integers).
        Example:
            <SACdefaultmap>-1, 2, 3, 0</SACdefaultmap>
        This assigns workers 2, 3, and 0 to SAC slave bees.
        The placement of the queen bee (the first integer) is determined
        by the snet system and cannot be influenced from within SAC, hence
        the value -1 should be always specified at the position.

    b) Name of an environment variable that will hold the list of worker IDs.
       The variable name starts by the '$' character.
        Example:
            <SACdefaultmap>$AMAP</SACdefaultmap>
        When the snet program starts it will look for the environment variable AMAP,
        and expect to find a list of worker IDs in it.
        So, the program may be executed like this:
            AMAP=-1,1,2 ./gigo_1-lpel <wkload-A00.xml
        The same note as above regarding the placement of the queen bee applies as well.


Diagnostics
--------------

*** SAC runtime warning
*** LPEL::SAC_MT_AllocHive: the mapping specification `places[0]' is not used, it shall be -1 to suppress the warning.

The "SACdefaultmap" metadata tag allows to specify the placement of SAC slave bees (tasks) onto the LPEL workers.
However, the SAC runtime cannot modify or influence the placement of the queen bee (that is, the "main" box task).
Therefore, the worker ID at the first position is unused in SAC and should be -1.
Most likely you have something like this:
    <SACdefaultmap>0, 1, 2</SACdefaultmap>
which incorrectly suggests that the queen bee will be placed on worker 0.
You have to change that to:
    <SACdefaultmap>-1, 1, 2</SACdefaultmap>
because you nor me don't know where the queen will be.


*** SAC runtime warning
*** In SAC4SNetFibreIO__PrintDoubleArray2: there was no hive attached to the calling thread!
    Created a temporary hive of one. The warning will not be repeated for this function.

The SAC printing function is called without an execution realm properly set-up.


(SNET FATAL (NODE 0 THREAD 46951069190544)In SNetExeRealm_create__mmul: the variable 'MMAP' not found in the environment!)

The variable MMAP was not found in the environment. It has been specified in one of the <SACdefaultmap> tags like this:
    <SACdefaultmap>$MMAP</SACdefaultmap>
