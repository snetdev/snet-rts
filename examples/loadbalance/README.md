Dynamic Load Balancing with the Feedback Combinator
===================================================

The programs in this directory demonstrate how to do
dynamic load balancing.

loadbalance.snet
----------------

This is just a generic design pattern.

raytrace.snet
-------------

This is a prototypical image generating application
which applies the loadbalance design pattern
to do dynamic domain composition.
It demonstrates that the Front runtime system
realizes this _very_ efficiently.
More details are in theses/GijsbersMSc13.
